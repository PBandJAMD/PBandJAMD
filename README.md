# PBandJAMD Forum/Chatroom

## Description
We want to make a forum application that allows users to post topics that they are interested in, for example, a certain coding topic that they need help with or a specific assignment. However, the forum is intended for any topics that are of interest to our users. We want to create mini "chatrooms" in each topic, similar to a forum, but live so that the page constantly updates when new posts are submitted encouraging a more active chatroom.
